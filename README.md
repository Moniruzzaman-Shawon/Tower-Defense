## 🕹️ How to Play
On the game page, you’ll see the map and available tower buttons.

Click a tower type to select it, then click a valid tile on the map to place it.

Each tower costs resources — watch your resource counter.

Enemies spawn in waves from the entrance and attempt to reach your base.

Defeated enemies grant you resources; use them to upgrade towers or place new ones.

As waves progress:

Enemy health and speed increase.

New enemy types may appear.

You’ll need to adapt your tower placements and upgrade path.

The game ends when your base is breached or you complete all waves (if specified).
